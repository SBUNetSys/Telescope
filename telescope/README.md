[Telescope source code]

In this repo, we provide the Telescope source code. Please put the `./src`
folder into your local `$GOPATH/src/github/hare1039` build path.

We also provide a [VM link] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jmOjIC1rcC7oT8vTftN8SKAfLBmypXjF?usp=sharing) to show how to run Telescope. This is only an emulation environment for quick testing. For real internet testing, please follow the instruction in the directory in the test dir.

Inside this vm, please go to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/hare1039/Telescope` to see the source code,
and go to `/mnt/d_drive/ipfs-abr-test/test-dir` to run the experiments.
